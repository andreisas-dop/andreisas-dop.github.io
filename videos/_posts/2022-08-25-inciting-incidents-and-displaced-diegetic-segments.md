We open on a 20 something Keanu Reeves with tarmac sliding behind him at a nausea inducing pace. His brow is filling up with perspiration as he looks upon a bomb that has been fastened to the undercarriage of a commuter bus and set up to blow up if the bus slows down to less than 50 miles per hour.

Cut to: 20 years later the same man, older, wearier, is mowing down with delicious precision an unstoppable deluge of faceless flunkies. This enthralling exercise in ultraviolence is rooted in one's man attempt to take an arguably exaggerated revenge upon those who broke in to his home, stole his prized property and killed his canine friend.

2001 a Space Odyssey (spoilers ahead) features on of the best cuts in the history of film. We cut FROM an ape throwing up their first tool into the sky in a celebration of their "mechanized” violence overpowering the violence of other apes TO  a military space satellite hovering menacingly in the vacuum of space millennia later.

There is a commentary on the phase transition within the subjects and approaches of cinema buried in there but will be left to the interpretation of the reader on a future, in depth look, at the nature and approach to plots in popular culture.

If you are still with me, thank you, congratulations, commiserations, there is more to come. You are crazy but in the best way possible. We are both embarking on an infinite jest, a literary journey of undefined length and scope that will take us through some of the thoughts and arguments that have taken root inside my mind. Some are keeping up at night, others colouring in my day-to-day experience and artistic practice.

All great stories have context, which in my opinion is what separates the great stories from the good ones. However, in the great battle for our fellow human's attention we have learned to lead with a hook, an inciting incident or strong narrative beat and then "cut to" the context that precedes it after we've captivated our audience.

Last month I was contacted by the Alumni team of my Alma Mater, The National Film and Theatre University "I."L. Caragiale" in Bucharest inviting me to give an interview about my career so far, the contribution the school made to who I am today and any advice I would give current students of recent graduates.

In the great tumble drier of life, it took me a while to get to replying to their questions, same way it has taken me a while to get to write this here text, arguably all my life. However, once I got into the process of tackling their queries it became an extremely humbling and cathartic experience.
It made reflect on where my journey started, the beats it has taken me through, where I am now and what has been learned.

While I've been enthralled by the moving image since as far as I can remember the inciting incident of my filmmaking career can be pinpoint to 9th grade when my literature teacher suggested that I would try and make a short film for extra credit. My grades were not stellar as I was testing poorly and she noticed that even though I could get through complex ideas in mind-numbingly long sentences, sic, my spelling in my native phonetic Romanian and the grammar around it we're for lack of a better word utter crap.

The years have revealed that I suffer, amongst other things, of a form of dyslexia known as dysgraphia. This, in the days before computerized authoring, AI driven writing helpers and in a language spoken only by about 20 million people made relatable self-expression somewhat difficult.

That all changed when I picked up the schools grimy Sony Hi8 camera. It took a veil off from in front of my eyes and gave me the opportunity and later, through a lot of work and dedication, the ability to show everyone how I saw the world, to reflect upon it and to present this reflection up for interpretation and/or consumption.

It's the biggest gift life has given me, for I have the possibility to extend my limited time spent pondering into the bullet proof realm of ideas. It's true that some ideas, like stray bullets, will never touch or be known by anyone, for some that's maybe for the better. However, I can't express enough the importance of film and filmmaking in my life.

And now we fold the narrative. What really incited what? Why? Maybe we will find out some day.

My first "short", "Where?" Opened up the floodgates and presented me with a world where my passion and thoughts were not bound by my inability of disability.

Fifteen years later, coming almost full circle, the interview request from my Alma Mater put me in the uncomfortable position of writing what is in essence an essay on myself. And while I find that repulsive as it felt like marketing tool, like a self-administered pat on the back, it also made me realize that this medium also presents an immense opportunity.

For as treacherous I still find the writing process, I am no longer a subversive snotty 15-year-old, but a subversive preppy 30-year-old and I can do this. Moreover, it made me feel good. So, I guess I'm going to keep trying to do it.

My day-job, my calling, my industry, my dream all live at the mercy of a complex network of ideas, an army of people and a funding and production apparatus that makes the journey from thought to representation a laborious, at times soul crushing and intensely time-consuming affair. And even though I would argue that my thoughts are comprised of shots and sounds and smells; emotions and sensations; a deconstructive engine that picks apart this controlled hallucination that we perceive as reality, I must submit that to a large extent even my neurodivergent brain uses words, language, as the core building block of its internal representation of external stimuli.

Henceforth I will attempt to take back the power that words have had over me and use them to exorcise my daemons, to explore with the censorship and guidance of only my personal filter the aspects of life that puzzle me that I haven't yet or will never be able to explore in my film practice.

I guess this has been a very long-winded way of explaining I'm starting a blog. I guess it also should work as a taster for things to come. If you are still here and you like what I have to say and how I say it, due tune in in a while to see where this has gone, better yet subscribe so you get notified of my next brain fart. (Once I figure out how I can make that happen on whatever platforms I end up disseminating this).

The texts that will follow will take the form of a loose collections of essays and personal anecdotes. There is no pretense that they will have any academic value, some of them might be naïve regurgitation of ideas I've been recently exposed to while others be problematic explorations of behaviors, approaches and art that has been haunting me for days, months, years, decades. Some, if not most, will center heavily around the art of filmmaking in general, cinematography and editing more specifically all with a heavy sprinkle of philosophy, semiotics and personal interpretation.

I can't make a promises about the regularity of the aforementioned musings, their quality, use or even fitness for human consumption. However what I can guarantee is that however many, however often they might appear, these writings will be an honest representation of my beautiful dark twisted fantasy.
