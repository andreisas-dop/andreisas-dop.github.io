As artists working in a medium that requires an incredible amount of
resources for the creation of even the most basic artefact, we may often
find ourselves deploring the limitations we feel have been imposed on us
by the various entities funding and managing our projects.

One only needs to engage in conversation with a director or any other
head of department on a bad day and there is a high probability that you
will hear a lament to the effect of: "If only production had given me
more time, more equipment, more creative freedom, my work would have
presented as the masterpiece that I knew it to be". This tends to be the
case no matter how successful they might be, or how far down their
journey in the medium.

It is true that in the history of Cinema there are copious examples of
studio interference compromising works of great artistic value due to
misunderstanding their fundamental thesis, aesthetics, or intended place
in the zeitgeist. Looking back at some of these examples quickly reveals
there can be much truth to the aforementioned laments: the various
versions<sup id='link1'>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
of Ridley Scott\'s [Blade Runner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner){:target="_blank"} (1982); the decreased
lack of coherence<sup id='link2'>[2](#footnote2)</sup> 
in the theatrical cut of Terry Gilliam\'s
[Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)){:target="_blank"} (1985), compared to the Director's Cut; Robert Richardson's
daring removal of his name<sup id='link3'>[3](#footnote3)</sup> 
from [World War Z.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z){:target="_blank"} (2013), due to a
perceived gross misrepresentation of his vision; or the plethora of
films disowned by their directors and credited with the now-retired DGA
pseudonym [Alan Smithee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Smithee){:target="_blank"}.

It's perfectly natural, and given the exaggerated egos of some
filmmakers, almost expected, to hold the belief that our vision for the
projects we give our every breath to is the only one that is valid.
However, what I have observed in the many years of my affair with
Cinema, is that the works that both I and many other film lovers return
to with praise and admiration are those that emerge from a synergetic
set of contributions, artistic gestures, and diverse points of view, all
brought to these projects by the artists, technicians and supporting
crew that work on any given film.

Given this multitude of contributions and the variance in taste,
ability, knowledge, and world view present in any given team,
disagreement can and will arise among the artists and the financial
stakeholders of a project, even when they all have the best interests of
the project in mind. This is inherent in the subjective nature of what
we do.

While differing outlooks can, in the best-case scenario, elevate the
film above any-one-person's vision, the sober reality of filmmaking is
that, most often, the views of those with more **power**, be it
financial, social or reputational, will limit the creative freedom of
their collaborators.

Case in point, a few months ago I had the privilege of watching on in a
great theatre Francis Ford Coppola\'s most recent and, based on its
abysmal box-office performance, very likely his last film. [Megalopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalopolis_(film)){:target="_blank"} 
(2024) was made by a generation-defining auteur, without the
interference of any studio executives, with a superlative cast and crew
of his choosing, and without many of the technical and financial
limitations that most of us have to work around.


![](/assets/img/blog/004.06_Megalopolis01.jpg){:width="70%"}

As such, this film should be, by the metrics of the lament presented
above, an unadulterated masterpiece. While the experience was like
nothing that I\'ve witnessed before, a masterpiece of the medium it is
not. The film took me through laughter, tears, intellectual stimulation,
mild boredom and some more tears at its conclusion, but this was more
due to my personal fondness of what it sets out to accomplish, my deep
knowledge of Coppola's 
[filmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola_filmography), and the context in which the film was made. Even with all the love I have for the man that taught me how
to _look into the heart of darkness_, and even at a first viewing, I
could not avoid noticing many of the film's failings --- failings both
the critical and audience consensus have subsequently confirmed.

While leaving the cinema, I was filled with more questions than answers;
not in the way I had grown to expect from Coppola's films, but more in a
genuinely baffling confusion. How can the maker of such undeniable
masterpieces as [The Godfather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather){:target="_blank"} (1972), [The Conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation){:target="_blank"} (1974) and
[Apocalypse Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse_Now){:target="_blank"} (1979) produce such a delightfully incoherent, poorly
paced mess?

These questions, and the subsequent observations, crystallised over time
into an introspection on my own artistic practice and the primary focus
of this text: What should be the nature of challenges and limitations in
the artistic process? How do they shape what we do?


![](/assets/img/blog/004.07_Limitations.jpg){:width="70%"}

When reflecting deeply on Coppola's filmography, one realises that his
best regarded works are part of a dialogue: a feedback loop of
collaboration and inspiration with the otherworldly yet so human works
of writers such as [Mario Puzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Puzo){:target="_blank"} and [Joseph Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad){:target="_blank"};  the personal
interpretations of actors such as [Marlon Brando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando){:target="_blank"}, [Al Pacino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino){:target="_blank"} or [Martin
Sheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Sheen){:target="_blank"}; the uncompromising photography of [Vittorio Storaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Storaro){:target="_blank"} or [Gordon Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Willis){:target="_blank"}; and the holistic approach to editing and sound of [Walter Murch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Murch){:target="_blank"}.

Not only Coppola's drive and creativity alone, but also the vision,
talent, restraint (or lack thereof<sup id='link4'>[4](#footnote4)</sup>) brought by his collaborators, is
what created the complex, synergetic m√©lange that made his best films so
memorable. The creative drive is still present in "Megalopolis": in the
boldness of trying to create a contemporary, high-concept fable which
parallels the fall of the Roman Republic to the deterioration of The
United States; in following through on an idea that has been haunting
him for nearly 50 years<sup id='link5'>[5](#footnote5)</sup> ; and last, but not least, in investing a
reported \$120 million<sup id='link6'>[6](#footnote6)</sup>  of his own money in a project he truly believed
in.

While the film could be seen as a personal triumph for Coppola, its
box-office<sup id='link7'>[7](#footnote7)</sup> and critical<sup id='link8'>[8](#footnote8)</sup>  failure could be attributed to something as
simple and as natural as the once great auteur becoming completely out
of touch in his old age. To avoid the implicit ageism of this
explanation, I propose that the outward failure stems from the decisions
to take it upon himself to write, direct, produce and finance such a
gargantuan undertaking, and by doing so, removing many of the points of
potential friction with other creators which have, many times in the
past, lead to filtration, reduction, and healthy ideation.

While we cannot be privy to how the filmmaking process actually
transpired, (though some articles in the trades have given us a rather
scathing image), we cannot ignore the inherent imbalance in power
dynamics between Coppola and everyone else involved in the project, and
how this imbalance could have affected his collaborators' ability to
stand up to what they might have regarded as suboptimal ideas, or to
make meaningful constructive contributions to the film.

Whatever the reasons behind the failure of "Megalopolis", the film
stands as a sobering reminder that, as artists, we have a duty to
periodically challenge ourselves and our base assumptions, and to
interrogate our methods and artistic goals. Our industry has a tendency
to reward overt confidence and bravado, but I wonder: doesn't a healthy
dose of doubt often lead to the kind of reflection necessary for
greatness?

![](/assets/img/blog/004.09_ArguingCrew.jpg){:width="70%"}


Then the question becomes: How do we challenge ourselves? How do we
choose which rules to follow and which rules to ignore?

From the formatting of a screenplay to the composition of our shots,
Cinema has been borrowing structure, language, and norms from all the
art forms that preceded it. These frameworks have slowly crystallized
into industry-wide practices that often remain unchallenged, creating a
feeling of artistic submission to an endless assembly line,
manufacturing content for the docile consumption of the increasingly
poorly-educated masses.

![](/assets/img/blog/004.10ScreenPlay.jpg){:width="70%"}

The industrial assembly of mass culture might seem like a perpetual
struggle between conformity and dissent, where neither the subversive
nor the submissive approaches to creation yield long-lasting, quality
results. But, I would argue that, looking back, the most impactful
filmmakers are the ones that manage to create a balance between informed
rules and their own personal dogma or "way of seeing", and that this
balance is what provides the audience with a distinct, personal,
authentic, yet naturally flawed mirror reflecting upon the human
condition.

"Authenticity" is, without a doubt, subjective. And like everything that
we find interesting, both as individuals and as a collective, its
meaning can change with the passage of time and the refinement of and
reflection upon our values. While some might find nothing intrinsically
natural or captivating in [Wes Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Anderson){:target="_blank"}'s jovially unhealthy obsession
with symmetry and pastel colours, or [Quentin Tarantino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino){:target="_blank"}'s propensity for
snappy editing and copious amounts of graphical violence, or any other
of the million quirks that some filmmakers exhibit, as a viewing public
we cannot deny these choices make their films distinct and memorable.
When these stylistic manifestations work, they tend to be informed by a
given set of beliefs (both about the nature of the world, as well as the
nature of the film medium) that make storytellers present their
narratives and thoughts in a particular way.

![](/assets/img/blog/004.11Aurora.jpg){:width="70%"}

This brings to mind one of [Cristi Puiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristi_Puiu){:target="_blank"}'s many thought-provoking lectures
during my film school days. In this lecture, while acknowledging that we
should all try and find our "own voice", he admitted that he, for one,
can't place the camera anywhere that he would not be able to normally
observe the world from. This means that, in his vision and in his
understanding of film language at the time, the camera should, for
example, never be mounted onto the exterior of a moving vehicle, or roam
in the sky freely like a bird, or present any bombastic framing or
movement. While this approach would be unacceptable to many other
filmmakers, limiting them to arguably dull, pedestrian perspectives, it
has served Mr. Puiu well and it has kept his perspective consistent
throughout his career.

While most of us only have snippets of these kind of "rules" that might
give our work some intrinsic consistency, other filmmakers have gone to
great effort to fully codify their approach so that the final film
resonates with their sensibilities.

The best example that comes to mind is [Lars von Trier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier){:target="_blank"} and [Thomas Vinterberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Vinterberg){:target="_blank"}'s "Dogma 95"<sup id='link9'>[9](#footnote9)</sup>: part avant-garde film movement, part reaction
to commercial filmmaking's overreliance on artifice. In order to codify
their vision, Vinteberg and Von Trier authored a "Vow of Chastity" that
was to govern all of their projects moving forward:

1.  Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not be brought in. (If a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found.)

2.  The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the scene is being shot.)

3.  The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.

4.  The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure, the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera.)

5.  Optical work and creative filtration are forbidden.

6.  The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)

7.  Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say, that the film takes place here and now.)

8.  Genre movies are not acceptable.

9.  The film format must be Academy 35 mm. (1.37:1 Aspect Ratio)

10. The director must not be credited.

"Furthermore, I swear as a director to refrain from personal taste! I am
no longer an artist. I swear to refrain from creating a "work", as I
regard the instant as more important than the whole. My supreme goal is
to force the truth out of my characters and settings. I swear to do so
by all the means available and at the cost of any good taste and any
aesthetic considerations. Thus, I make my VOW OF CHASTITY."

Their seemingly genuine desire for authenticity and the pursuit for
truth is laudable, but also an incredibly prohibiting standard to hold
one's self accountable to in the making of a long-form dramatic film.
While this approach surely yields a self-consistent, cohesive vision and
presentation, it unavoidably stifles one's opportunity exploration, and
creates a sense of rigidity of form that can very easily be destructive
to the synergy that could arise in the whole.

This was proven rather quickly to be the case, as the two directors only
made three films adhering to the framework: Thomas Vinterberg's [The Celebration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Celebration){:target="_blank"} (1998), and Lars von Trier's [The Idiots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiots){:target="_blank"} (1998) and [The Boss of It All](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boss_of_It_All){:target="_blank"} (2006).

![](/assets/img/blog/004.12TheCelebration.jpg){:width="70%"}

Another example of a basic formalisation of one's aesthetic approach is
the seemingly simple choice of angle of view that we tell our stories
with.
While most films are shot with a great variety of focal lengths and thus
angles of view, throughout cinema's history there have been a plethora
of films shot with only one lens<sup id='link10'>[10](#footnote10)</sup>.
Whether it is [Orson Welles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles){:target="_blank"} exploring
the consequences of pride and entitlement with a [30mm Baltar](https://theasc.com/articles/zero-optik-rehouses-baltars){:target="_blank"} in [The Magnificent Ambersons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Ambersons_(film)){:target="_blank"} (1942); [Henry Koster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Koster){:target="_blank"}'s [The Robe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Robe_(film)){:target="_blank"} (1953), transporting us to
ancient Rome using the revolutionary (at the time) [50mm CinemaScope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScope){:target="_blank"}; Wes Anderson's playful intimacy in [Bottle Rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_Rocket){:target="_blank"} (1996), enhanced by a [27mm Panavision Primo](https://uk.panavision.com/camera-and-optics/optics/product-detail/sl-primo){:target="_blank"}; or [L√°szl√≥ Nemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Nemes){:target="_blank"}' harrowing portrayal of a singular
story during the Holocaust, narrated with the claustrophobic accuracy of
a [40mm Zeiss Master Prime](https://www.zeiss.co.uk/consumer-products/cinematography/master-prime-lenses.html){:target="_blank"} in [Son of Saul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_Saul){:target="_blank"} (2015); committing to a single lens
can ground one's narrative and bring into focus the importance of the
physical placement of the camera and how it relates to its subject.

![](/assets/img/blog/004.13SonOfSaul.jpg){:width="70%"}


My favourite approach to the codification of one's understanding of
their creative process is the stylistic outline<sup id='link11'>[11](#footnote11)</sup> that [Terrence Malick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Malick){:target="_blank"} and
[Emmanuel Lubezki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Lubezki){:target="_blank"} created in the preparatory phase<sup id='link12'>[12](#footnote12)</sup> for [The Tree of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life_(film)){:target="_blank"} 
(2011): 

1.  Shoot in available natural light

2.  Do not underexpose the negative, keep true blacks

3.  Preserve the latitude in the image

4.  Seek maximum resolution and fine grain

5.  Seek depth with deep focus and stop: "Compose in depth"

6.  Shoot in backlight for continuity and depth

7.  Use negative fill to avoid "light sandwiches" (even sources on both sides)

8.  Shoot in crosslight only after dawn or before dusk; never front light

9.  Avoid lens flares

10. Avoid white and primary colours in frame

11. Shoot with short-focal-length, sharp lenses

12. No filters except Polarizer

13. Shoot with steady handheld or Steadicam "in the eye of the hurricane"

14. Z-axis (depth) moves instead of pans or tilts

15. No zooming

16. Do some static tripod shots "in midst of our haste"

17. Accept the exception to the dogma ("Article E")

While echoing many of the sentiments present in Dogma 95, and placing
emphasis on capturing the story through a naturalistic lens<sup id='link13'>[13](#footnote13)</sup>, the two
filmmakers manage to strike a balance between their intent and how
limiting it is to their artistic goals. With the inclusion of "Article
E" they allow themselves the flexibility to adapt the style they
outlined to the realities of what unfolds, while trying to stay true to
their creative ethos. This, in turn, presents the opportunity of synergy
and of "happy accidents" to arise and expand the meaning and complexity
of the final film.

![](/assets/img/blog/004.14TreeOfLife.jpg){:width="70%"}


Each filmmaker has their own way to reach the "language" that they use
for a project. While some go through their entire career iterating on
the same set of guiding principles, in my own practice, I attempt to
approach each project as a new opportunity to learn something about how
I can look at a world. My belief is that if I, as an artist, go through
a journey of discovery, that curiosity and sense of awe will be imparted
to the audience.

After reading the script for any given project, I try to not let myself
fall into the patterns that my gut feelings and routine dictates. I
write notes of my ideas as they come, but then lock them away from my
mind until I get to discuss the project with the director and see what
their vision for it is.

Before we can discuss lenses and cameras, lighting ratios and specific
references, I find it paramount to have a shared understanding of what
we are attempting to make. In order to be able to slowly put into words,
then thoughts, then frames and feelings what has yet to be photographed,
at the beginning of any collaboration, I try to profoundly engage
directors with a flurry of questions such as:

<ul style="width: 85% !important; margin: 0 auto 30px auto">

<li><p> How would they describe the story? I'm not looking for the synopsis
or the tagline they would give investors, but their personal
interpretation of what the film is. Is it, for example, about the
fluidity of family in the post-modern era or the confusing joy of a
pleasant formative experience?</p></li>

<li><p> Who is the protagonist? How much are we, the filmmakers, and the
audience that we serve, allowed to know about them?</p></li>

<li><p>How close or far is the world of the film from our own world, our own
plane of existence? Does Starbucks exist in this world, do they <b>still</b>
sell coffee?</p></li>

<li><p>Who is telling this story? How omniscient is the narrative
perspective? How attached or detached it is to the story that unfolds?</p></li>

<li><p> Is there a God in this world? What about fairness? Do reason and the
scientific method apply? Is this the world of our dreams or of our worst
nightmare?</p></li>

</ul>


What are we making?

<ul style="width: 85% !important; margin: 0 auto 30px auto">

<li><p> Are we making art for art's sake, exploring the human condition so
that we may all better understand ourselves and each other?</p></li>

<li><p> Are we making light entertainment to offer our audience a reprise
from the perpetual grind of the political and economic systems we find
ourselves part of?</p></li>

<li><p> Are we making a political manifesto to guide our audience to our own
definition of utopia, or signal an alarm towards political and cultural
trends that we find troubling?</p></li>
</ul>


Some filmmakers might scoff at how esoteric the questions are,
especially coming from a Cinematographer, but through exploring them as
creative partners, they guide us towards creating a framework, a dogma
if you'd like, for self-consistent, authentic films. These questions
are, to me, the beginning of every good filmmaking journey, and along
with the answers that we find along the way, they form the foundation on
which I judge what we've made at the end.

The personal examination of the pitfalls of unlimited creativity, pinned against
the claustrophobia of a perceived "rigid corset" that studio-led
filmmaking entails, has led me to the humbling acceptance that **any**
dogma, whether **theirs** or **ours** can fail when faced with the
immensity of the human condition.

Considering all of the above, my resolute yet personal conclusion is
that in order to understand the essence of what we are working with, we
need to find our own ways to challenge it, as well as ourselves,
especially in the absence of external pressures.

Thus, the goal should be to give ourselves a brief of our own making and
to work within the limitations that our current world view imposes,
while accepting and embracing the spectacle that unfolds in front of us.
We should aim to construct a framework for our creative process that can
help others understand and remind ourselves why and how "we see", so
that we don't lose ourselves in our endless pursuit of sculpting in
time.
