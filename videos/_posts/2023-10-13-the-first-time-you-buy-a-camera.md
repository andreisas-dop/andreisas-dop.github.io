description: 'As someone who creates images for a living, I often get approached with a straightforward question: "What camera should I buy?" The answer to which is always a pretty deflating "It depends." The following essay will explore everything I wish I had known before buying my first camera.'
---

To re-appropriate a quote by Nicholas Cage, playing Yuri Orlov in
"Lord of War" (2005): "The first time you buy a camera is a lot like
the first time you have sex. You have absolutely no idea what you're
doing, but it is exciting, and one way or another, it's over way too
fast."


Congratulations on accepting that you want a camera in your life! You
are now entering the ranks of an "anointed" class of people with more
money than sense who, by and large, spend too much time obsessing over
their rapidly depreciating technological atavism and too little actually
making images. 

![](/assets/img/blog/003.01_PhotographerWelcome.png){:width="70%"}

All jokes aside, I commend anyone who makes the leap and invests in
image-making, be it photography, videography or filmmaking. Using a
dedicated camera will change how you approach photography and video, and
will give you an extremely rewarding means to reflect on the world and
express your experience in it.


But, before you go out spending your hard-earned credits on a [Mamiya
645](https://mrleica.com/mamiya-645-super/){:target="_blank"} or [Hasselblad
X-Pan](https://www.hasselblad.com/about/history/xpan/){:target="_blank"} (which is what I
would do if money were no object), you should probably ask yourself a
series of questions. The answer to those questions should lead you to the "perfect
camera" for you.


The following text represents a personal, unabridged thought process of
selecting cameras - developed after more than 15 years from my first camera
purchase. Whether you are a novice or a pro, looking for your first
"real" camera or thinking of a change in your photography approach,
there's something here for everyone.


### Do you actually need a camera?


An old adage goes along the lines of "the best camera is the one you
have with you", which I perpetually connect to the monumental [Henri
Cartier-Bresson](https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/henri-cartier-bresson/){:target="_blank"}.
Many consider him the father of street photography, and he made
photographic history equipped with his (at the time) amateur-grade [Leica
M3](https://camerapedia.fandom.com/wiki/Leica_M3){:target="_blank"}. Following that train
of thought, since Nokia released
the [7650](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_7650){:target="_blank"}, most of us have
had some sort of camera in our pockets.

While for most of their history, camera phones and later smartphones
were the poor siblings in the photon gathering marathon, in the last
five years, they've made such improvements that even I struggle to tell
if an image was captured on a phone or a "real camera" if I don't go
pixel peeping.


So, if you have just started your photography journey and have spent
more than £600 on a phone in the last few years, you might have
everything you need to start creating images. Your main goal should be
to take control over the image-making process. So, put your image-taking
device in manual mode and start learning how to explore the world around
you through
[composition](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/photography/discover/photo-composition.html){:target="_blank"},
[exposure](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/photography/discover/exposure-in-photography.html){:target="_blank"}
and
[colour](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/hub/guides/what-is-color-contrast.html){:target="_blank"}.
If you are unsure how best to use your phone as a camera, have a read
through [Jo Bradford's "Smart Phone Smart
Photography"](https://amzn.eu/d/iq3NmiT){:target="_blank"} and try creating your first
few series without spending anything more. 


![](/assets/img/blog/003.04XperiaPhotography.png){:width="70%"}

Most people tend to ascribe good photography and video to "the best
equipment", but after more than a decade doing it and tens of thousands
of pounds spent, I can assure you that technique, experience, and taste
are 80% of what makes a good image. I would argue that for most casual
photographers/videographers, a good smartphone used with intent and
skill can deliver all that they need.


### How should one pick a camera?

<div class="right-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.05CameraPile.jpg" width="30%">
</div>

The first thing that will probably bewilder you when buying a camera is
the sheer number of options you are presented with regarding brands,
prices and form factors. There is a lot of myth, too much marketing, and
an unhealthy level of almost religious zealotism in the camera world.

Canon shooters will tell you that the [Canon
R3](https://www.canon.co.uk/cameras/eos-r3/){:target="_blank"} is the best thing since
sliced bread, while Nikon shooters will boast how the [Nikon
Z9](https://www.nikon.co.uk/en_GB/product/cameras/z-9){:target="_blank"} will
literally [take the picture for
you](https://cameradecision.com/blog/Nikon-Z9-Auto-Capture-Explained-in-Detail){:target="_blank"}.
To be frank, most big brands offer fantastic cameras if you spend more
than £800 on a new body, which makes the choice even more complicated.


So, instead of approaching the camera acquisition problem from a
technical marketing-driven perspective, let's approach it for what it
actually is: an art form, a profession, a hobby. What camera to get
should be a philosophical, ethical and experiential question tied to the
aesthetics of what and how you want to reflect upon the world around
you.

You should ask yourself what and how you would like to photograph.
For example, suppose your primary interest is shooting lush
contemplative landscapes where you wait for hours or days staring at the
horizon, waiting for the light and atmospheric conditions to be "just
right". The best camera for that is probably
a [medium-format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_format){:target="_blank"} film [Hasselblad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasselblad){:target="_blank"},
Bronica, or a digital [Fujifilm
GFX100s](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-gb/products/cameras/gfx100s/){:target="_blank"}. 


If, however, your goal is to snap candid moments in the markets of
Marrakesh while on your way to the next adventure, a [lightweight
APS-C](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-e4/){:target="_blank"} camera with
good AF and [a fast and light 23mm
f:1.4](https://www.sigma-global.com/en/lenses/c023_23_14/){:target="_blank"} prime that
you know like the back of your hand is probably the best choice. With
it, you can be inconspicuous and capture moments of honesty without your
subjects becoming self-conscious due to the presence of a large and
intimidating camera.


After you've achieved a modicum of technical proficiency, the embodied
experience and connection with your subjects while creating the
image will have a drastically more significant effect on the final
photograph (or video) than the technical specifications of your camera.

### What makes a good photography experience?

The photographic experience is subjective and starts with how the camera
feels in your hands and on your body, how the image looks in the
viewfinder or on the screen, how easily it is to trigger the shutter,
and how appealing the sound it makes is. After ['the decisive
moment'](https://petapixel.com/the-decisive-moment/){:target="_blank"} of the shot, the
question becomes: how easily and intuitively can you obtain the image from your mind's eye,
either directly from the camera, or through subsequent analog or
digital processing?

Some people prefer having a large-body camera with many buttons and
features, while others want the stripped-down point-and-shoot
experience. There are no right or wrong ways.


<div class="two-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.08FullCamera.jpg">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.09CompactCamera.jpg">
</div>

Some people will prefer composing their shots through an optical
viewfinder, while others will consider having an articulating screen paramount,
so they can more easily get high and low-angle shots.


<div class="two-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.10Viewfinder.jpg">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.11ScreenPhotography.jpg">
</div>

Some image-makers will require the most cutting-edge,
AI-driven [phase-detect
AF](https://photographylife.com/how-phase-detection-autofocus-works){:target="_blank"}, 6K
RAW Video Recording or blazing-fast [sensor readout
speeds](https://www.photometrics.com/learn/white-papers/rolling-vs-global-shutter){:target="_blank"},
while others will want to slow down and meditate while they go through
the "ritual" and contemplation that manual focus film photography
entails.

The most important thing is to understand what you want **your**
relationship with the creative process to be, what your strengths and
weaknesses are, and only then pick a camera that makes the most sense
for you.

When confronted with a plethora of similarly specced and similarly
priced cameras, especially when you haven't figured out precisely what
your photographic interests are, pick a camera whose industrial design
you find visually appealing. You will need to be carrying that thing
with you everywhere in order to get good, and, as shallow as it might
sound, you want to feel proud when you take it out of its bag because it
is an extension of yourself, of your personal style.

### What makes a good camera?

A good camera is a camera that empowers the user to create an accurate
representation of their reflection of their subject, at any given time,
with ease and haptic satisfaction. There are a plethora of technical
factors that go into the creation of a technically sound image. Still,
at the end of the day, a good camera and lens combination should produce
an aesthetically pleasing image that can be presented in the creator's
desired medium without the artifice of its creation becoming apparent.

While absolute technical image quality is essential for a very narrow
set of photographers doing reproduction, medical or scientific imaging,
for the rest of us, the goal should always be to create images that tell
a story, create a mood, excite the eye, inspire or emote.

![](/assets/img/blog/003.13PhotographeratWork.png){:width="70%"}

Photography, Film and Video have always lived in a dichotomy between
artistry and technology. While aesthetics and experiential aspects are
subjective, the fundamental technical aspects, in which many get bogged
down, can be easily simplified. 

Image quality from a camera's perspective can, whether captured into
film emulsion, recorded electronically onto magnetic tape or stored as a
file on digital media, be described by three characteristics: **spatial
resolution, dynamic range** and **colour resolution (colour gamut).**

<div class="right-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.14.SpatialResolution.jpg" width="50%">
</div>


**Spatial Resolution** represents the smallest
feature that an image can represent, assuming perfect optics (which
don't exist), which is, in turn, defined by the size of the [film grain
crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_halide){:target="_blank"} or [photosite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/photosite){:target="_blank"} for
a given imager size. It is often expressed in
"[megapixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel){:target="_blank"}" (MP) in digital
cameras and has been historically erroneously used as the sole consumer
metric for camera quality.

Your choice of spatial resolution should be determined by where and how
your images will be viewed.
If you mainly publish to social media or YouTube, anything between 2 to
12 MP is enough.
If you are printing, it depends on the print size and the printer's
DPI. Some huge museum-quality prints can require 50MP or more.

For film and video, you will generally want a \~3K (6MP) sensor to get a
crisp 2K/HD image and a \~6K (22MP) sensor to get a crisp 4K/UHD image.
In some video and cinema cameras, manufacturers use advanced algorithms
to extract a
4K [raster ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics){:target="_blank"}out of a
\~4000 [photosite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/photosite){:target="_blank"} wide
[Bayer-pattern-filtered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter){:target="_blank"}
[CMOS image sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-pixel_sensor){:target="_blank"}
(the standard sensor type in virtually all modern digital cameras). In
my opinion, that is a slight cheat as it contradicts [the
Nyquist--Shannon sampling
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem){:target="_blank"},
which, while grossly oversimplifying, tells us that you can expect to get about 0.7 of the resolution of
your [RAW image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format){:target="_blank"} in your
final [raster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics){:target="_blank"} from a
Bayer-filtered sensor. 

I know some fantastic artists out there who still shoot on a
10-year-old [Sony a7S I](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/e-mount-body-ilce7-series/ilce-7s){:target="_blank"} with its 12MP sensor due to its portability, superlative low-light
performance and extended compatibility with vintage lenses, so it goes
to show that pixel count is probably the least important technical part
of a camera.


<div class="left-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.15DynamicRange.jpg" width="20%">
</div>

[**Dynamic
Range**](https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/video/discover/dynamic-range.html){:target="_blank"} is
the ratio between the brightest and darkest parts of an image that a
camera can record while retaining their detail in one exposure. In order
to achieve pleasing results, you will want a camera that can record at
least 10 stops of dynamic range.


<div class="right-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.15.2ColourGamut.png" width="20%">
</div>

[**Colour
Gamut**](https://www.viewsonic.com/library/photography/what-is-color-gamut/){:target="_blank"} is
the total number of shades and hues a sensor or film stock can
differentiate, and a display device can reproduce. Each camera has its
own native gamut that can be loosely extrapolated from the [bit
depth](http://preservationtutorial.library.cornell.edu/tutorial/intro/intro-04.html){:target="_blank"} of
the file produced (the higher, the better).

If you are deeply interested in the technical side of photography,
specifically resolution, dynamic range and other tech specs, feel free
to consult repositories of camera data such as [DP
Review](https://www.dpreview.com/){:target="_blank"} or [DxO
mark](https://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/){:target="_blank"}. I don't find those
particularly useful beyond comparing competing products, as the most
important tests for a camera are the subjective ones. 


### Should I get a DSLR or a mirrorless camera?

[SLRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera){:target="_blank"} and
the [DSLRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera){:target="_blank"} that
replaced them have been the professional workhorses of the photographic
world ever since their mass adoption in the [late 1950s and early
1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_single-lens_reflex_camera){:target="_blank"},
but as the 2000s were coming to a close, many manufacturers started
releasing [rangefinder-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera){:target="_blank"} interchangeable
lens [mirrorless
cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_camera){:target="_blank"}.

In the beginning, these were niche products targeted at travel and
street photographers who needed high-end performance in small and
lightweight inconspicuous bodies. The trend continued through the early
2010s until Sony introduced the [Sony
a7](https://www.dpreview.com/products/sony/slrs/sony_a7){:target="_blank"} as the first
Full-Frame mirrorless camera, which, with its subsequent revisions,
variants and offerings from other manufacturers, completed
photography's transformation to a fully digital experience.

![](/assets/img/blog/003.16CameraEvolution.png)

I am tremendously fond of the unique experience of composing through
a [pentaprism mirror
viewfinder](https://photographyinsider.info/pentaprism-vs-pentamirror-which-is-better/){:target="_blank"},
where the light reflected by the subject is directly focused onto my
retina through as little tertiary interpretation as possible. I use film
SLRs whenever I want to slow down, contemplate, meditate, and rebalance
my appreciation of photography.

That being said, professionally, I've given up on DSLRs as the image
and exposure preview, weight-saving, and advanced autofocus features
that mirrorless cameras offer are too good to be ignored for the sake of
my poetic relationship with the image-making device.

DSLRs are fantastic "first cameras" at the moment, especially since they
are currently flooding the used market. Due to their technical
limitations, they force the user to slow down more, appreciate the shot
and hone in on their craft gradually as they shoot, process the RAW
files and repeat.


![](/assets/img/blog/003.17Protogs.jpg){:width="70%"}

Many seasoned pros will keep their top-end DSLR for years to come as
they are reliable, rugged, and produce outstanding images in their
hands. But, as those cameras age and manufacturers slowly discontinue
their DSLR lines (with the [exception of
Pentax](https://www.dpreview.com/news/3144603843/pentax-announces-the-kf-a-slightly-tweaked-version-of-its-k-70-aps-c-dslr){:target="_blank"}
at the time of writing), we are all heading towards a mirrorless world.

If you intend on buying a new camera, I can't see any technical reason
why you would buy a DSLR today - besides particular
physiological and medical edge cases that have to do with motion
sickness, ability to focus and eye fatigue.


### Should I buy a film camera?

I can't profess my love for shooting film enough. It has made me the
cinematographer I am today, and it was the beginning of my photographic
journey. Film photography is as pure of an experience as possible, and it
encourages the shooter to be creative, deliberate and effervescent. Film
is a very forgiving medium that can provide an emotionally engaging
visual experience both in shooting and viewing with minimal
post-processing.

As a learning tool, it provides a very steep learning curve when it
comes to exposure, composition, and best practices that, once mastered,
empowers the photographer to tackle any visual challenge.

![](/assets/img/blog/003.18Film.png){:width="70%"}

To this day, I get a sense of absolute awe whenever I get the
opportunity to develop and print in a dark room. Seeing an organic,
vibrant image slowly emerge from the chemical bath is absolutely
hypnotic.

That being said, the last five years have made it increasingly difficult
to shoot film. Many cameras of the early to mid-90s (which can be seen
as the apex of film camera technology) have started failing to the point
of no return. The few models still being manufactured are not
particularly good, and the cost of raw film stock has skyrocketed.


![](/assets/img/blog/003.19Darksoom.jpg){:width="70%"}

Shooting one roll of Kodak Ektar 100 35mm colour film will cost £12,
then developing is £8, and high-resolution scanning (6700x4500px TIFF)
is £15, or you can get basic prints for £8. Whichever way you look at
it, it's getting close to £1/ picture, which is a bit much to swallow
for most people.

If you can afford it, do give film photography a try as it is the purest
form of this art, but be ready to shoot very little or spend very
much.


### Do I need a Full-Frame camera?

A great deal of the photographic discourse of the last couple of decades
has been taken up by the endless debate and posturing on the advantages
and "absolute necessity" of using a Full-Frame camera if you want to
be a serious photographer. While the mirrorless revolution has
challenged that to a large extent, many still claim that Full-Frame is
the only way.


If I'm being slightly facetious, "Full-Frame" doesn't exist. To be
more precise, it didn't exist as a term until the advent of digital
cameras and the need to differentiate early models equipped with
APS-C-sized "crop" sensors from the standard "Full-Frame" film gauge
of the time. The "Full-Frame" film format, more accurately known
as [135 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/135_film){:target="_blank"}, is
a [Leica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_Camera){:target="_blank"} adaptation of the
early 20th century in which perforated [motion picture film
stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_stock){:target="_blank"} was run through a
photography (stills) camera horizontally in order to create a portable,
easy-to-use camera that produces a negative that is 36 x 24 mm. 


Until the 1950s, 135 film itself was considered an amateur "crop"
format in relation to the medium-format professional cameras used at the
time and their 84 x 56mm negative. As film chemistry improved and a
desire for more organic and affordable photography emerged in the 1960s,
many consumers and professionals alike adopted the format, becoming the
standard way to create photographs.


Filmmaking started out on essentially 135 film from the get-go, which,
with the advent of the [Bell and Howell
perforation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_perforations){:target="_blank"}, was
solidified as the format known today as Super35 with a negative size of
24.9 mm x 18.6mm, which is "surprisingly" close to the 23.7 x 15.6mm
negative size of APS-C. For all practical purposes regarding [angle of
view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_view_(photography){:target="_blank"}) (AOV),
depth of focus and
"look", [Super35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_35){:target="_blank"}, [APS-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS-C){:target="_blank"} and [Half-Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-frame_camera){:target="_blank"} are
interchangeable terms.


![](/assets/img/blog/003.20AS_Common_Sensor_Sizes.png)


<div class="right-img">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="/assets/img/blog/003.21Sensor.jpg" width="30%">
</div>

Thus, I would like to urge the reader, from this point forward, to avoid
calling APS-C-sized sensors "crop" as it's both historically
inappropriate and creates an unhealthy bias in our mind that implies
that APS-C is somehow "lesser". One of the best image sensors on the
market at the moment is the Super35 size [Alev IV
sensor](https://ymcinema.com/2022/05/30/the-new-alev-4-sensor-might-become-arris-greatest-technological-achievement/?expand_article=1){:target="_blank"} in
the [ARRI Alexa
35](https://www.arri.com/en/camera-systems/cameras/alexa-35){:target="_blank"}.

It is true that, assuming similar diode
technology, materials purity and manufacturing processes are used, a
Full-Frame sensor with the same photosite count will, on average,
have [1 to 2 stops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number){:target="_blank"} more dynamic
range and low light capabilities than its APS-C/Super35 counterpart due
to the photosite being 1.5x larger on FF than S35, allowing for more
light to be gathered on each, and more spread out, leading to less
interference from adjacent photosites and better overall heat
dissipation. So it should come as no surprise that the Full-Frame sensor
in the [Sony
FX6](https://www.sony.co.uk/interchangeable-lens-cameras/products/ilme-fx6-body-kit){:target="_blank"},
with its 8.3<span class="greek">µ</span>m photosite, has more dynamic range and performs better at
high ISOs than the [Sony
FX30](https://www.sony.co.uk/interchangeable-lens-cameras/products/ilme-fx30){:target="_blank"},
with its 3.7<span class="greek">µ</span>m photosite.

In an ideal world, I would leave the "Crop" vs. Ful-Frame conversation
at that, but in practice, most manufacturers do treat the APS-C sensor
as their "lower-tier" offering and, as such, use
cheaper-to-manufacture sensors in them. To my knowledge, notable
exceptions are Sony's Alpha 6000 line of cameras and Fujifilm's X-T,
X-E and X-Pro lines, which pack "Full-Frame" performance into compact
APS-C cameras with no obvious cost-cutting observable.

To summarise, in photography, bleeding-edge performance will always be
found in the flagship Full-Frame or medium-format cameras of each
manufacturer. That being said, one should not easily disregard APS-C as
a primary camera option. How much image quality is enough is subjective,
bringing us back to one of the central themes at hand: aesthetics and
usability.

Aesthetically, with Full-Frame, you gain:

-   a shallower depth of field for any
    given [f-stop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number){:target="_blank"} and AOV 

-   a wider 1.5x wider AOV for any given focal length, which can enable
    you to get closer to your subjects, leading to even more background
    separation but also potential perspective distortion

-   in some edge cases, lens manufacturers can employ simpler designs
    for their "wide" lenses, which are less prone to optical
    aberrations, especially when coupled
    with [short-flange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flange_focal_distance){:target="_blank"} [mirrorless
    camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_camera){:target="_blank"} mounts.

APS-C camera's advantages are:

-   smaller weight and physical size on average compared to an
    equivalent Full-Frame camera

-   lighter and more affordable lens selection

-   better suited for macro and nature photography, where the crop
    factor helps with image magnification


Full-Frame cameras are often more technically proficient and can provide
better image quality than their APS-C counterparts, but they will not
make you a better photographer, videographer or filmmaker. Don't feel
pressured by marketing and spec-envy to think that "unless you shoot
Full-Frame, you are not doing it right".

### Should I buy new or used?

Whenever feasible, I advise buying used; your bank balance and the
planet will thank you. 

If you are starting out, you don't need the latest and greatest camera,
and you will benefit more from buying a model that is one to two
generations old and investing what you've saved in better lenses. Most
"kit lenses" (the lenses supplied with many prosumer cameras) are
optical abominations made to the tightest of cost limitations.

Most professionals keep using their equipment even when it's two or
three generations old as long as it still does what they need it to do
when they bought it. For them, it's a business decision. The longer
they can keep earning with a camera, the more return they will get on
their original investment.

As a word of caution, if image quality is something you care a lot
about, don't buy anything older than a decade. Sensors have come a
long, long way since 2013, and the images coming off most of the older
ones are likely to be worse than a modern high-end smartphone.

![](/assets/img/blog/003.22Cameraporn.jpg){:width="70%"}

My go-to place for used equipment is [MPB](https://www.mpb.com/en-uk){:target="_blank"}.
They always have a good selection, and while their prices are not the
best (eBay will always be your best bet there), I trust that their cameras
will have been appropriately checked, and that I will be able to return
them if I'm not happy with their condition or functionality. 

For film cameras, it's trickier these days, especially when you don't
know the good makes and models, or how to check them. A good
brick-and-mortar camera store would be my first choice, though some bank 
on their clientele's lack of knowledge and practice unconscionable prices.
Always compare the price for a particular model
with eBay.

![](/assets/img/blog/003.23CameraStore.jpg){:width="70%"}

If, for whatever reason, you decide to buy a new camera, you should make
sure that you will be okay to use that camera for at least 5 years. A
cheap camera and a good one have very similar environmental
manufacturing costs, so for all our sakes, please abide by "buy nice or
buy twice", as we don't know for how long this planet can sustain our
insatiable desire for new and shiny things.


### What camera would you recommend?

Given all of the above, it should be apparent that it's hard to
recommend any one camera, but I will try to provide some options with
the caveat that they are only valid at the time of writing and will be
biased by my own experience, artistic philosophy and personal taste. As
much as I try to be objective, there are platforms that I know better
than others, and I am wary of recommending equipment that I have not
tested myself.

To conclude, you have to sit down and meditate. Ask yourself: what kind
of pictures do you want to take creatively? How do you want to engage with
the camera? Do you want a more laid-back experience? Do you need an
eyepiece? (You do!) Only after you have those answers you can determine
what equipment gets you what you want.


And to bring it all back full-circle, I will end with the words of Henri
Cartier-Bresson: "Your first 10,000 photos are your worst". So you'd
better just grab yourself a camera, any camera, [forget the
numbers](https://youtu.be/ko_V6LZ-zqQ?si=nEXeiIMig60MvzIE){:target="_blank"}, and start
shooting!
