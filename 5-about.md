        <p>Andrei Sas is a London-based, meticulous, story-driven Cinematographer working in narrative, drama, documentary and advertising. He first picked up a video camera in 2007 and since then has been wondering the world in a pursuit to commit to permanence moments that move him.</p>

        <p>Following a lifelong obsession with the moving image fuelled during his youth by the escapist nature of cinema and unadulterated consumption of unregulated cable TV, he studied at the National Film and Theatre University in Bucharest where he graduated with honours.</p>

        <p>Growing up in the cultural tapestry that is the shore of the Black Sea, Andrei was inspired to seek out an eclectic array of artistic movements, being equally fond of the works of Andrei Tarkovsky, Lucian Pintilie and Sergei Parajanov on one hand, and Terry Gilliam, Ridley Scott and Mike Leigh on the other.</p>

        <p>His practice is rooted in complete dedication to his projects and a continuous drive to render the extraordinary in the mundane. This has led to his work being screened around the world, garnering multiple awards.</p>
